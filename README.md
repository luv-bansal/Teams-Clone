## Agile-Methodology

Agile is a development
methodology adopted today in the
software industry.

### SCRUM
SCRUM is a subset ofAgile, a framework for developing software.
SCRUM takes advantage of
different techniques to
achieve goals in Agile.

**SCRUM** promotes an iterative model
where the planning is performed on a
very short term. 1 = 2 weeks
**SPRINT**.
The basic time working unit is the sprint.
SCRUM teams always reason in sprints
and their planning is limited to sprints

## **How Agile is followed in the project**    

Used **Trello** for overall development and management of Application.

At the beginning of this training programme, divided my project into sprints.

Then at the beginning of each sprint, I used to maintain my to-do list, and I used to update it, after every end of day.

This made me keep track of my progress, and results in completion of project on time. 


## Tech stack

- ### **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)**
     
    Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google. It allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. 

    I have used flutter for UI design and all other functionaties of appication.

- ### **[Dart](https://dart.dev/)**
    
    Dart is the programming language used to code Flutter apps. Dart is another product by Google 
- ### **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**

    Used firebase as a backend for user authentication and to store all information in database
    
- ### **[Agora Flutter SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/flutter/index.html)**
    The Agora Flutter SDK wraps the Agora RTC SDKs for Android and iOS, with which you can quickly implement real-time communication functionality in Android and iOS apps developed using the Flutter framework.
